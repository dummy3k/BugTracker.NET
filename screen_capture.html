 the latest version of the BugTracker.NET Screen Capture Utility</a>from Sourceforge.
<p>
The BugTracker.NET Screen Capture Utility lets you capture a screen shot, annotate it, and post it to BugTracker.NET in just a few clicks.
<p>
Before you can use the utility, you need to click on "Configure..." to tell it where your BugTracker.NET website is and
who you are.  If you want, you can get a head start by generating a ".reg" file here
 with your initial settings.    Click to <a href=generate_btnetsc_reg.aspx?version=_1.7&action=generate>generate</a> it, then save it and click on it, to import your initial settings to your registry.
<p>
The screen capture utility looks like this:
